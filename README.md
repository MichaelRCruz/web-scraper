## Web Scraper

This is a web-scraping application designed to detect the existence of specified html elements. As of now, there are very obvious limitations to this application. The first being that I don't know of all the possible edge cases in which the HTML elements are rendered. Second, dynamically rendered content is not caught by the scraper. This was initially solved by using a virtual browser, but that came by means of Casper.js.
